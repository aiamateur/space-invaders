# Space Invaders
Embedded Systems (EC EN 427)

This is a recreation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders using the Atlys Spartan-6 development board. Space Invaders was introduced in Japan in 1978 and was wildly successful. The game was so successful that it caused a shortage of 100-yen coins.
